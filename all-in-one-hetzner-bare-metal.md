# ODK bare metal deployment

This  manual describes a way of how to run the installation on a bare metal hetzner box.

It is meant to complement [Hetzner OCP](https://github.com/RedHat-EMEA-SSA-Team/hetzner-ocp), where a cluster like setup is not needed or appropriate.

This is done without installing the logging/metrics System, because there is no value added when someone needs an environment for app-developement/customising apps or executing a showcase.
The purpose is to have a real openshift smell like development-sandbox but not a fully blown cluster.

The procedure can be executed in approximately 3-4h, where attention is needed for 1-2h approx.


#Install Base OS

There is a preparation to be achieved.

This is taken from:

https://github.com/RedHat-EMEA-SSA-Team/hetzner-ocp#install-instructions

The simplest way of partitioning is:
```
DRIVE1 /dev/sda
DRIVE2 /dev/sdb
SWRAID 1
SWRAIDLEVEL 1
BOOTLOADER grub
HOSTNAME CentOS-76-64-minimal
PART /boot ext3     512M
PART lvm   vg0       all

LV vg0   root   /       ext4     200G
LV vg0   swap   swap    swap       5G
LV vg0   tmp    /tmp    ext4      10G
LV vg0   home   /home   ext4      40G


IMAGE /root/.oldroot/nfs/install/../images/CentOS-76-64-minimal.tar.gz
```

To specify the rest of available space on the drive, you can easily use "all" at the last partition.

There is more information about the [**Installimage script**](https://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/Installimage/en).

For a box 2*2GB, if the image is not available just check for the next version of CentOS.

After the image has installed, first update packages and enable SELinux, as it comes disabled:

```
$ yum -y update
$ vi /etc/selinux/config

SELINUX=enforcing

# Restart the server.
$ sync; reboot

# Check SELinux status.
$ getenforce
-> Enforcing
```

Install the following packages:

```
$ yum -y install screen git
```

# Install ODK


Please read the section upfront but slightly change some commands

https://github.com/gshipley/installcentos

Skip step 2.

and clone with:

```
# I recommend use screen program to prevent session termination once install script executed.
$ screen
# Use your Git-Fork or use:
$ export GIT_USER=gshipley
$ git clone https://github.com/${GIT_USER}/installcentos
```
Then Export the following variables; these will take control over the
process os installation where relevant:

```
### Optional: export SCRIPT_REPO=browse to your **RAW** fork of rep:
### export SCRIPT_REPO=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${GIT_USER}/installcentos/master

$ export METRICS="False"
$ export LOGGING="False"

```

3. Execute the installation script

```
$ cd installcentos
$ ./install-openshift.sh
```

# Secure System with Firewall

While the installation is running you might want to configure the FireWall:
